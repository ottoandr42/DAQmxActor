# DAQmxActor

Requires actor messages (for abstract messaging).

The actors provided as-is likely dont need to be overridden if you are doing basic things with DAQmx. Just configure your task, make a new daqmx actor of the necessary IO type, and launch it using the provided launchers or the built-in AF launchers.

Install on your system using the VIP file in the builds directory. A new palette will be available for DAQmx actors.
